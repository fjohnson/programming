#All primitive data types are signed. 
#A _byte_ is a signed 8 bit quantity with range -128 to 127.
#A char is a 16 bit unicode character with range 0 to 65,535.
#In java 7 number literals can be defined with '_' as a delimiter between numbers
for example... 0xDEAD_BEEF or 0b1001_1101; binary literals only exist in java 7.
#fields are either class instance variables or static class variables. local 
vars and parameters to methods are not fields. fields are initialized with
a default value while local vars are never given default values.
#overloaded methods are separated based on the parameter list. the return type
is not considered so you cannot declare two methods but with different return
types. 
#decimal literals default as doubles. So a literal '3.0' is a double and not
a float. 
#A class with no constructors is provided with a default no argument constructor
by the compiler. This constructor will call the super class' no argument 
constructor so you must be careful that one exists.
#Doing a static import of an overloaded method will import all versions of
that overloaded method. 
#Imports cannot be done for classes in the default package. Static imports
cannot be done either. This is because an import statement is of the form:
import package.path.path.class. The default package cannot be equalified.
#If a constructor does not explicitly call its super's constructor then
the super's no arg constructor is called by default. This no arg must exist
or an error will occur.
#A super class' constructor evocation must always be the very first 
statement found in a child's constructor.
#static code blocks are executed in the order that they are found when a class
is first loaded. Instance code blocks are copied into every constructor.
